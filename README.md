This script calls [You Need a Budget's](api.youneedabudget.com)'s API endpoints to get all transactions logged since a certain date from YNAB, then preprocesses them into the same formatting as a Google Sheet my wife and I keep to balance expenses. 

Mostly, this works with YNAB's API directly, and the tidyverse-style R package [googlesheets](https://github.com/jennybc/googlesheets).

No double hand-entering of expenses ever again!
